      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm going to bootcamp to find a different career path after getting laid off from my job betting on the ponies with Chucky and Leeroy.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Burlington, North Carolina. Yes, like the Coat Factory. We have one there but the company was started in Burlington, Vermont.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like to make electronic music and bet on the ponies at the track with Chucky and Leeroy.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Victoria's Secret Angel</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in North Nashville but I'm currently quarantining at my girlfriend's apartment in East Nashville until she kicks me out or her cats kill me in my sleep.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always been fascinated with technology. Growing up in a small town in North Carolina led me to spending a large part of my formative years online. I'm intrigued by the potential of the intersection of art and technology.</p>
